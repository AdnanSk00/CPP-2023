// *********************************        Exercise on C++ Inheritance       ********************************
/*
    Create 2 classes :
    1. SimpleCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using utility function and performs +, -, *, / and displays the results  using another function.
    2. ScientificCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs any four scientific operations of your choice and displays the result using another fuction.

    Create another class HybridCalculator and inherit it using these 2 classes :
    Q1. What type of Inheritance are you using?  ----> Multiple Inheritance 
    Q2. Which mode of Inheritance are you using?  ----> public SimpleCalculator, public ScientificCalculator
    Q3. Create an object of HybridCalculator and display results of simple and scientific calculator.
    Q4. How is code reusability implemented?
